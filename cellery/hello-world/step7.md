Cellery images can be pushed and pulled from any container registry like Docker Hub. This enables cells to be re-used.

The Cellery push command allows you to push your cell image to the Docker Hub. You must have a Docker Hub login for this to work. 
`cellery push DOCKER_USERNAME/hello-world:1.0.0`

Congratulations, You have successfully deployed your first hello world Cell.  :)

(Later: After getting all above working, try to get cellery view working.)
